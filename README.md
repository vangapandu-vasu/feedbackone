Feedback Form Project
This is a simple React application where users can submit feedback. The application includes form validation, feedback submission, and an Admin View where all submitted feedback can be displayed. It also includes responsive design and user-friendly elements for a better user experience.

Features
Feedback Form: Users can enter their name, email, and feedback.

Form Validation: Email input field validates the email format before submission.

Submit Feedback: Once the feedback is submitted successfully, a success message appears.

Admin View: An admin can view all the feedback submitted by users.

Responsive Design: The form is styled to be responsive on various screen sizes.

Theme Switch: Switch between dark and light themes to change the look and feel of the app.

Technologies Used
React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.

CSS: Styling for the application, including both light and dark themes.

Axios: To make HTTP requests for submitting feedback.

React Router: For navigation between different pages (Home, Admin View).

State Management: Managed using React’s useState and useEffect hooks.

Form Validation: Regular expressions are used for validating email input.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

App.js
The root component where the theme toggle button is located.

It contains a button to navigate to the Admin View.

Home.js
Contains the feedback form where users can input their name, email, and feedback.

Email validation is implemented to ensure the email follows a correct format.

Feedback is submitted to the backend using axios upon form submission.

Admin.js
Displays all feedback submitted by users. It fetches the data from the backend and shows it to the admin.

Admin can view the name, email, and feedback of each submission.

Home.css / Admin.css
CSS files to style both the Home (Feedback Form) and Admin views.

Styling includes layout, form styling, button styling, and color schemes for responsiveness.

Theme Toggle Button (Optional Enhancement)
There is an optional button to toggle between light and dark themes.

How to Add New Features
To add new features to this app, follow these steps:

Identify the component where you want to add the new feature (e.g., adding more form fields, improving admin functionality).

Implement the feature within the component (e.g., adding a new state variable in React to handle additional input).

If necessary, create new routes in react-router-dom and update the navigation accordingly.

Test the feature locally to ensure it works as expected.
